Sunsets
We wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
So you open your dress and show me your tits
On the swing set at the old playground
And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
Sunsets
I wanna hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like Brautigan's book covers
That we both adored
And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days
And when you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
When you go away
I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
